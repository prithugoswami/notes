## Aparokshanubhuti

Aparokshânubhuti is an introductory text about the philosophy of Vedâta written
by Adi Shankaracharya.

These notes were written while listening to Swami Sarvapriyananda's lectures on
Aparokshanubhuti.  In this series of talks, Swami Sarvapriyananda lucidly
unfolds the path to direct "Self-Realization" presented by Adi Shankaracharya
in Aparokshanubhuti.  The text for this series is a translation of Adi
Shankaracharya's Aparokshanubhuti by Swami Vimuktananda. Vidyaranya has written
commentary to this text and Swami Saravpriyananda uses his explanations and
base his explanations off of his for some of the verses.
