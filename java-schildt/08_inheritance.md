# Chapter 8 -- Inheritance 

## Points to remember
- Member access - a subclass inclues all of the superclass members, but it
cannot access those memebers of the superclass that are declared as `private`
- A major advantage of inheritance is that you can define a class with all
the common attributes, and then extend that class and add more specific 
attributes required
- A reference variable of a superclass cab be assigned a reference to any
subclass derived from that superclass
